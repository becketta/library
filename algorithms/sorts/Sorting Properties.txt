Sorting algorithm properties:

STABLITY:
	Stable sorting algorithms maintain the relative order of records with equal keys.

ADAPTABILITY:
	Whether or not the presortedness of the input affects the running time.
	Algorithms with improved runtime on presorted inputs are known to be adaptive.

ONLINE:
	An online sorting algorithm can sort input as it receives it. In other words, it
	doesn't need all the input before it can start sorting.
